# Partitioning hard drive in Linux OS

##### 1. Use `fdisk` command to delete a hard disk partition:

`fdisk` also known as format disk is a dialog-driven command in Linux used for creating and manipulating disk partition table. It is used for the view, create, delete, change, resize, copy and move partitions on a hard drive using the dialog-driven interface. `fdisk` allows you to create a maximum of four primary partitions and the number of logical partition depends on the size of the hard disk you are using. 

##### 2.  View All Disk Partitions:

The first thing to do before doing any thing with the disks and partition is to view basic details about all available partition in the system.

```{txt}
sudo fdisk -l
```

##### 3.  View Partition on a Specific Disk: 

Below command is used to view all disk partitions on device /dev/sda.

```{txt}
sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda
```

##### 4.  Delete a Hard Disk Partition:

To delete a partition for the hard disk and free up space occupied by that partition for example /dev/sda. Go to the command menu using following:

```{txt}
sudo fdisk /dev/sda
```

- And then type `d` to go to the delete partition menu. It will prompt the partition number you want to delete (type the number).

- Again type `d` to delete the specific partition.

- Run `w` command to write the changes and reboot the system.

- Continue this process until you delete all target partitions.

# Ubuntu and Fedora proxy in KUT

# STATA17 installation in Ubuntu/Fedora

First copy your **STATA17** source file in the **Downloads** folder of your PC. 

If the file is in **.zip** format, unzip to use it. Confirm that the **.tar.gz** extension file (Linux supported installation file) is located in the **Downloads** folder. 

I am assuming that you have the licence information ready in your hand during the following installation process:

##### Step 1: Create the installation directory, and change location into it

```{txt}
cd Downloads
```

```{txt}
mkdir statainstall
```

```{txt}
tar -xvzf Stata17Linux64.tar.gz -C statainstall
```

##### Step 2: Create the installation directory, and change location into it

```{txt}
sudo mkdir /usr/local/Stata17
```

```{txt}
cd /usr/local/Stata17
```

##### Step 3: Run the install script

```{txt}
sudo ~/Downloads/statainstall/install
```

Here, you will start the installation process and STATA17 will provide you the steps to complete. Follow these steps one by one and complete until the end.

##### Step 4: Configure the license file

```{txt}
sudo ./stinit
```

Again, STATA17 will ask you for several conformations and you need to respond properly.

##### Step 5: Running STATA17 with a graphical user interface using the command

```{txt}
./xstata
```

##### Step 6: Unity launcher and desktop file

Even after successfully installing and running Stata, in Ubuntu/Fedora it won’t be available as an application in the dash, and it won’t have a proper icon in the application launcher. We can easily fix this by creating a **.desktop** file for Stata.

```{txt}
sudo gedit /usr/share/applications/stata17.desktop
```

In this newly-created file just copy and paste the following, obviously adjusting it if you have a different version or flavor of Stata:

```{txt}
[Desktop Entry]
Version=17
Terminal=false
Icon=/usr/local/Stata17/stata17.png
Type=Application
Categories=Education;Scientific;
Exec=/usr/local/Stata17/xstata

```

# Nano, a popular terminal-based text editor

GNU nano (or we call it “nano”) is a simple terminal-based text editor. Some shortcuts include:

```{txt}
Ctrl + X to exit
Ctrl + O to write (or save as)
Alt + U to undo last action
```
