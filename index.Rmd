### Background

I am Dr. Moinul Islam, currently an Associate Professor at Kochi University of Technology. I earned my Doctor of Engineering (equivalent to Ph.D.
in Environmental Engineering) degree from Kyushu University in 2016. My expertise spans agriculture, climate, ecological, environmental, and behavioral economics, with a particular interest in experimental economics. My research focuses on applying economic models to address critical public policy challenges, particularly in the area of intergenerational sustainability. I am engaged in understanding the far-reaching impacts of climate change and natural disasters on human life and finding solutions through evidence-based public policies.

I have extensive experience in designing laboratory, field, and survey experiments, as well as in collecting and analyzing primary data to address my research questions. I am proficient in analyzing secondary data, including cross-sectional, time series, spatial, and panel data by employing advanced econometric techniques to derive robust insights for my research. For over a decade, I have been actively researching climate change adaptation and public policy, particularly in developing countries, examining how public policies can better protect climate vulnerable populations.
