### Background

I am Dr. Moinul Islam, currently an Associate Professor at Kochi
University of Technology. I earned my Ph.D. from Kyushu University in
2016. As an applied economist, my expertise spans agriculture, climate,
ecological, energy, environmental, and behavioral economics, with a
particular focus on experimental economics. My research focuses on applying economic models to address critical policy challenges, particularly in the area of intergenerational sustainability. **I have extensive experience in collecting and analyzing both primary data (such as laboratory, field, social, and survey experiments) and secondary data (including cross-sectional, time series, spatial and panel data), using econometric techniques to address key research questions.** For over a decade, I have
been actively researching climate change adaptation, particularly in
developing countries, examining how policies can better protect
vulnerable populations. I am deeply engaged in understanding the
far-reaching impacts of climate change and natural disasters on human
life and am committed to finding solutions through evidence-based
economic policies.
