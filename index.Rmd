# Profile

I am Dr. Moinul Islam, working as an Associate Professor at Kochi University of Technology. I have received my Ph.D. in Engineering degree from Kyushu University in 2016. I am an applied economist specializing in agriculture, climate, ecological, energy, environmental, and behavioral economics with a special interest in experimental economics. For more than a decade, I have been conducting research by examining the climate change adaptation behavior in developing countries. This work looks into what policies are there to protect vulnerable people. Currently, I am conducting research in the fields of applied microeconomics, climate science, economic policy, environmental policy, and health policy.
