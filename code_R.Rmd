# 1. `Pacman`  package manager

- Install `pacman` Package in R. In order to use the functions that are contained in the `pacman` package, we have to install and load the package to R:

```
install.packages("pacman")    # Install pacman package
library("pacman")             # Load pacman package
```

- After running the previous lines of code, we can use the functions provided by the `pacman` package.

##### Example 1: Install & Load Multiple R Packages Using p_load Function

In this example, I will illustrate how to apply the p_load function to load multiple add-on packages in one line of code.

Have a look at the following R syntax:

```
p_load(ggplot2, dplyr, stringr)   # Install & load packages
```

After executing the previous code, we have loaded the three packages `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and `stringr`.

Note that the p_load function also checks whether a package is installed already. If the package is not installed yet, it is installed automatically by the `pacman` package.

##### Example 2: Unload Multiple R Packages Using p_unload Function

Another useful function of the `pacman` package is the p_unload function. The p_unload function can be used to detach one or multiple loaded packages from within R.

Let’s apply the p_unload command to unload the three packages `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and `stringr` that we have loaded before:

```
p_unload(ggplot2, dplyr, stringr)  # Unload packages
```

The following packages have been unloaded: `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `stringr`
The previous output of the RStudio console tells us that our three packages were detached.

##### Example 3: Update Outdated R Packages Using p_update Function

In this example, I will show how to use the p_update function of the `pacman` package to check for outdated packages AND to update all of these packages.

- First, let’s check which of my packages are outdated:

```
p_update(update = FALSE)  # Check for outdated packages
```

- Second, the `pacman` package provides an easy solution to how we can update all outdated packages with only one line of R code.

- Make sure that you have some time before running the following R code. This may take some time, depending on the number of packages you need to update:

```
p_update() # Update all packages
```
- Quick Reference Table

```
p_load		      #Loads and Install Packages
p_install	      #Install Packages from CRAN
p_load_gh	      #Loads and Install GitHub Packages
p_install_gh	  #Install Packages from GitHub
p_temp		      #Install a Package Temporarily
p_unload		  #Unloads Packages from the Search Path
p_update	      #Update Out-of-Date Packages
```
# 2. Quarto codes

### 2.1 Making subfigures in quarto document

```
#| label: fig-1
#| fig-cap: "Inclusive wealth of India from 1990 to 2018"
#| out.width: "50%"
#| echo: false
#| fig-subcap: 
#|   - "1990"
#|   - "2000"
#|   - "2010"
#|   - "2018"
#| layout-ncol: 2

knitr::include_graphics('figures/iw_1990.jpg')
knitr::include_graphics('figures/iw_2000.jpg')
knitr::include_graphics('figures/iw_2010.jpg')
knitr::include_graphics('figures/iw_2018.jpg')
```

For loading a figure with customizing options, we can use following codes

```
{r, echo=FALSE, out.height="60%", out.width="60%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap="Discipline"}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/discipline.jpg")
```
Here, we can adjust the height, width, alignment and caption of the figure.
