### Package manager

####  pacman

[pacman](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pacman/index.html)
Install `pacman` package in R. In order to use the functions that are contained in the `pacman` package, we have to install and load the package to R:

```{txt}
install.packages("pacman")    # Install pacman package
library("pacman")             # Load pacman package
```

After running the previous lines of code, we can use the functions provided by the `pacman` package.

- Example 1: Install & load multiple R packages using p_load function

In this example, I will illustrate how to apply the p_load function to load multiple add-on packages in one line of code.

Have a look at the following R syntax:

```{txt}
p_load(dplyr, stringr)   # Install & load packages
```

After executing the previous code, we have loaded the packages `dplyr`, and `stringr`.

Note that the p_load function also checks whether a package is installed already. If the package is not installed yet, it is installed automatically by the `pacman` package.

- Example 2: Unload multiple R packages using p_unload function

Another useful function of the `pacman` package is the p_unload function. The p_unload function can be used to detach one or multiple loaded packages from within R.

Let’s apply the p_unload command to unload the packages `dplyr`, and `stringr` that we have loaded before:

```{txt}
p_unload(dplyr, stringr)  # Unload packages
```

The following packages have been unloaded: `dplyr`, `stringr`
The previous output of the RStudio console tells us that our three packages were detached.

- Example 3: Update Outdated R Packages Using p_update Function

In this example, I will show how to use the p_update function of the `pacman` package to check for outdated packages AND to update all of these packages.

First, let’s check which of my packages are outdated:

```{txt}
p_update(update = FALSE)  # Check for outdated packages
```

Second, the `pacman` package provides an easy solution to how we can update all outdated packages with only one line of R code.

Make sure that you have some time before running the following R code. This may take some time, depending on the number of packages you need to update:

```{txt}
p_update() # Update all packages
```

### Econometrics

#### Basic linear regression

- *Estimation and standard inference:* Ordinary least squares (OLS)
  estimation for linear models is provided by `lm()` (from stats) and standard
  tests for model comparisons are available in various methods such as
  `summary()` and `anova()`.
  
#### Microeconometrics

- *Generalized linear models (GLMs):* Many standard microeconometric models
  belong to the family of generalized linear models and can be fitted by
  `glm()` from package stats. This includes in particular logit and probit
  models for modeling choice data and Poisson models for count data.
  
- *Effects and marginal effects:*  Effects for typical values of regressors
  in GLMs and various other probabilistic regression models can be obtained
  and visualized using r pkg ("effects"). Marginal effect tables and
  corresponding visualizations for a wide range of models can be be produced
  with r pkg ("marginaleffects", priority = "core"). Other implementations
  of marginal effects for certain models are in r pkg ("margins") and
  r pkg ("mfx"). Interactive visualizations of both effects and marginal
  effects are possible in r pkg ("LinRegInteractive").
  
- *Binary responses:* The standard logit and probit models (among many
  others) for binary responses are GLMs that can be estimated by `glm()` with
  `family = binomial`. Bias-reduced GLMs that are robust to complete and
  quasi-complete separation are provided by r pkg ("brglm"). Discrete choice
  models estimated by simulated maximum likelihood are implemented in
  r pkg ("Rchoice"). r pkg ("bife") provides binary choice models with fixed
  effects. Heteroscedastic probit models (and other heteroscedastic GLMs) are
  implemented in r pkg("glmx") along with parametric link functions and
  goodness-of-link tests for GLMs.
  
- *Count responses:* The basic Poisson regression is a GLM that can be
  estimated by `glm()` with `family = poisson` as explained above. Negative
  binomial GLMs are available via `glm.nb()` in package r pkg ("MASS").
  Another implementation of negative binomial models is provided by
  r pkg ("aod"), which also contains other models for overdispersed data.
  Zero-inflated and hurdle count models are provided in package r pkg ("pscl").
  A reimplementation by the same authors is currently under
  development in r rforge ("countreg") on R-Forge which also encompasses
  separate functions for zero-truncated regression, finite mixture models etc.
