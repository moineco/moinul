### Package manager

Install `pacman` package in R. In order to use the functions that are contained in the `pacman` package, we have to install and load the package to R:

```{txt}
install.packages("pacman")    # Install pacman package
library("pacman")             # Load pacman package
```

After running the previous lines of code, we can use the functions provided by the `pacman` package.

#### Example 1: Install & load multiple R packages using p_load function

In this example, I will illustrate how to apply the p_load function to load multiple add-on packages in one line of code.

Have a look at the following R syntax:

```{txt}
p_load(ggplot2, dplyr, stringr)   # Install & load packages
```

After executing the previous code, we have loaded the three packages `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and `stringr`.

Note that the p_load function also checks whether a package is installed already. If the package is not installed yet, it is installed automatically by the `pacman` package.

#### Example 2: Unload multiple R packages using p_unload function

Another useful function of the `pacman` package is the p_unload function. The p_unload function can be used to detach one or multiple loaded packages from within R.

Let’s apply the p_unload command to unload the three packages `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and `stringr` that we have loaded before:

```{txt}
p_unload(ggplot2, dplyr, stringr)  # Unload packages
```

The following packages have been unloaded: `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `stringr`
The previous output of the RStudio console tells us that our three packages were detached.

#### Example 3: Update Outdated R Packages Using p_update Function

In this example, I will show how to use the p_update function of the `pacman` package to check for outdated packages AND to update all of these packages.

- First, let’s check which of my packages are outdated:

```{txt}
p_update(update = FALSE)  # Check for outdated packages
```

- Second, the `pacman` package provides an easy solution to how we can update all outdated packages with only one line of R code.

- Make sure that you have some time before running the following R code. This may take some time, depending on the number of packages you need to update:

```{txt}
p_update() # Update all packages
```
- Quick reference table

```{txt}
p_load		      #Loads and Install Packages
p_install	      #Install Packages from CRAN
p_load_gh	      #Loads and Install GitHub Packages
p_install_gh	  #Install Packages from GitHub
p_temp		      #Install a Package Temporarily
p_unload		  #Unloads Packages from the Search Path
p_update	      #Update Out-of-Date Packages
```
