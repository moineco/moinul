### Stata17 installation in linux

First copy your **Stata17** source file in the **Downloads** folder of your PC.

If the file is in **.zip** format, unzip to use it. Confirm that the **.tar.gz** extension file (Linux supported installation file) is located in the **Downloads** folder.

I am assuming that you have the licence information ready in your hand during the following installation process:

##### Step 1: Create the installation directory, and change location into it

```{txt}
$ cd Downloads
```

```{txt}
$ mkdir statainstall
```

```{txt}
$ tar -xvzf Stata17Linux64.tar.gz -C statainstall
```

##### Step 2: Create the installation directory, and change location into it

```{txt}
$ sudo mkdir /usr/local/Stata17
```

```{txt}
$ cd /usr/local/Stata17
```

##### Step 3: Run the install script

```{txt}
$ sudo ~/Downloads/statainstall/install
```

Here, you will start the installation process and Stata17 will provide you the steps to complete. Follow these steps one by one and complete until the end.

##### Step 4: Configure the license file

```{txt}
$ sudo ./stinit
```

Again, Stata17 will ask you for several conformations and you need to respond properly.

##### Step 5: Running Stata17 with a graphical user interface using the command

```{txt}
$ ./xstata
```

-   If you have a problem to execute the above code, you need to install `gtk2`
-   You can install by:

```{txt}
$ sudo apt install gtk2 # For Ubuntu
$ sudo dnf install gtk2 # For Fedora
```

##### Step 6: Unity launcher and desktop file

-   Even after successfully installing and running *Stata17*, in Ubuntu/Fedora it won’t be available as an application in the dash, and it won’t have a proper icon in the application launcher.

-   To complete this step, you need a text editor. In this tutorial, I am using `gedit` which is the official text editor of the GNOME desktop environment. If your PC don't contain it, you can install easily by using terminal.

```{txt}
$ sudo apt install -y gedit # For Ubuntu
$ sudo dnf install -y gedit # For Fedora
```

-   Then we can easily fix this by creating a **.desktop** file for *Stata17*.

```{txt}
$ sudo gedit /usr/share/applications/Stata17.desktop
```

-   In this newly-created file just copy and paste the following, obviously adjusting it if you have a different version or flavor of *Stata*:

```{txt}
[Desktop Entry]
Version=17
Terminal=false
Icon=/usr/local/Stata17/stata17.png
Type=Application
Categories=Education;Scientific;
Exec=/usr/local/Stata17/xstata
Name=Stata/BE 17
Comment=Perform statistical analyses using Stata.
StartupNotify=true
MimeType=application/x-stata-dta;application/x-stata-do;application/x-stata-smcl;application/x-stata-stpr;application/x-stata-gph;application/x-stata-stsem;
Actions=doedit;use;view;graphuse;projmanag;semopen;
```

##### Step 7: Stata update process

-   If SELinux is enabled in your PC, use following command to provide permission to your Stata to get updated. If SELinux is disabled, the following step is not necessary.

```{txt}
$ sudo chmod -R 777 '/usr/local/Stata17'
```

-   If your internet connection is through a proxy server, add the proxy information inside your Stata to ensure update process as below.

```{txt}
a. Open Stata
b. Go to Preferences
c. General Preferences
d. Internet
e. add the proxy information. For KUT [proxy.noc.kochi-tech.ac.jp] and port [3128]
f. Go to Help
g. Update
```
