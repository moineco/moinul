# Org roam
Homepage (<https://www.orgroam.com/>)

- Org Roam is an extension to Org Mode. Install the org-roam package from MELPA using package.el, straight.el or any other package manager you normally use to install packages.

- Inside your Emacs working environment, need to customize **.emacs** file to become able to utilize the necessary packages.

- If you use use-package with package.el, add this to your configuration temporarily and execute it to install org-roam: 

```{txt}
(use-package org-roam
  :ensure t)
```

- After ***Org Roam** has been installed, the most important thing to configure is the folder where your Org Roam files will be located.

- By default, this will be a folder called org-roam in your **HOME** directory but you will probably want to set this to something else. No matter what path you use, things will be slightly easier if you create the folder in advance! 

- We’ll also add some necessary key bindings and a call to org-roam-setup to make sure everything is ready to go. 

```{txt}
(use-package org-roam
  :ensure t
  :custom
  (org-roam-directory "/Users/username/Documents/Dropbox/roam_notes")
  :bind (("C-c n l" . org-roam-buffer-toggle)
         ("C-c n f" . org-roam-node-find)
         ("C-c n i" . org-roam-node-insert))
  :config
  (org-roam-setup))
```

- If you’ve never used Org Roam before, you can set the variable org-roam-v2-ack to t in your configuration. Here’s how to set the variable in your configuration:

```{txt}
(use-package org-roam
  :ensure t
  :init
  (setq org-roam-v2-ack t)
  :custom
  (org-roam-directory "~/RoamNotes")
  :bind (("C-c n l" . org-roam-buffer-toggle)
         ("C-c n f" . org-roam-node-find)
         ("C-c n i" . org-roam-node-insert))
  :config
  (org-roam-setup))
```

- Creating your first node. Let’s create our first node! We can use the *C-c n f* binding to invoke org-roam-node-find which brings up a completion session to select or create a node.

- Since we want to create a new node, we can type in the desired node name “Programming Languages” and press **Enter**.

- For now, we can add some text to the file and then press *C-c C-c* to confirm the capture to save the file. 

- Let's follow the same process to create another node called “Emacs Lisp”. 

- The real power of Org Roam begins when you start linking your node files together! 

- Here's an updated configuration that makes node completions easier: 

```{txt}
(use-package org-roam
  :ensure t
  :init
  (setq org-roam-v2-ack t)
  :custom
  (org-roam-directory "~/RoamNotes")
  (org-roam-completion-everywhere t)
  :bind (("C-c n l" . org-roam-buffer-toggle)
         ("C-c n f" . org-roam-node-find)
         ("C-c n i" . org-roam-node-insert)
         :map org-mode-map
         ("C-M-i"    . completion-at-point))
  :config
  (org-roam-setup))
```
