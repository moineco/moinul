# Quarto within RStudio

RStudio includes support for editing and preview of Quarto documents. 

### YAML Intelligence

#### Documentation options

Document options are defined using YAML. For .qmd files, this YAML should appear at the start of the text file. For Jupyter notebooks, the YAML should appear as the first cell, which should be a raw cell. The first and last lines of this cell consist of three hyphens (---). Elements are specified as key:value pairs, and sub-elements are indented. Below you will find a host of document options you can edit in quarto.

##### Project options

```{txt}
---
project:  type: "default" # [default, website, book] type of output
execute-dir: "file" # [file, project] working directory for computations
output-dir: "output" # generate outputs (for instance, images, html, pdf) in this directory
---
```

##### Format options

```{txt}
---
format: pdf # [html, pdf, docx, odt, pptx, revealjs, beamer, gfm, commonmark, mediawiki, epub, ipynb] file format for the rendered document
---
```

There are many other output formats available than the ones listed in the comments above. The options available vary depending upon the format that is chosen.

---
tbl-colwidths: [70, 30] # ["auto", true, false, <array>] Should tables wider than
                        # 72 characters have explicit column widths?
                        # "auto": Use Markdown column widths unless the column
                        # contains a hyperlink
                        # true: Always use markdown column widths
                        # false: Never use markdown table widths
                        # <array>: Column widths as the %age of table width

```

##### Links

```{txt}

##### References

```{txt}
---

---
```

#### Generate document

##### Preview

While authoring your document, use the preview to quickly see its current state. The generated preview will open in a browser. Consider having your Jupyter notebook, IDE, or text editor and the preview visible on-screen at the same time.

Open a terminal

```{txt}
$ quarto preview document_name
```

##### Rendering

Once you have finished authoring your document, you can render the final version.

Open a terminal

```{txt}
$ quarto render document_name
```

This will create rendered documents in the file formats specified in the YAML header. 
To override the file format, use the following command variant:

```{txt}
$ quarto render document_name --to {format} # [pdf, html, docx]
```

# Quarto within JupyterLab

Quarto can render `JupyterLab` represented as plain text (`.qmd`) or as a normal notebook file (`.ipynb`). One benefit of using `.ipynb` is that you can use `JupyterLab` as your editor.

#### YAML Front Matter

The first cell of your notebook should be a `Raw` cell that contains the document title, author, and any other options you need to specify. Note that you can switch the type of a cell to Raw using the notebook toolbar:

```{txt}
---
title: "Python for Data Science"
author: "Moinul Islam"
date: "4/30/2024"
format: 
  html:
    code-fold: FALSE
jupyter: python3
---
```

Note that weâ€™ve added the jupyter: python3 option to the `YAML` front matter to indicate which `Jupyter kernel` to render with. You would render this document with:

```{txt}
quarto render basics-jupyter.qmd
```

#### Converting notebooks

You can convert between `.ipynb` and `.qmd` representations of a notebook using the quarto convert command. For example:

```{txt}
quarto convert basics-jupyter.ipynb # converts to .qmd
quarto convert basics-jupyter.qmd   # converts to .ipynb
```

#### Render without preview

```{txt}
quarto render notebook.ipynb
quarto render notebook.ipynb --to docx
quarto render notebook.ipynb --to pdf
```

#### Cell Execution

When rendering an `.ipynb` Quarto will not execute the cells within the notebook by default. If we want to execute the cells we can pass the `--execute` flag to render:

```{txt}
quarto render notebook.ipynb --execute
```

#### JupyterLab extension

The Quarto `JuptyerLab` extension enables `JupyterLab` which use Quarto markdown to properly display the contents of the markdown cells. 

```{txt}
python3 -m pip install jupyterlab-quarto  # Mac
py -m pip install jupyterlab-quarto  # Windows
```
