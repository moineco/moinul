# Quarto render JupyterLab

Quarto can render `JupyterLab` represented as plain text (`.qmd`) or as a normal notebook file (`.ipynb`). One benefit of using `.ipynb` is that you can use `JupyterLab` as your editor.

##### YAML Front Matter

The first cell of your notebook should be a `Raw` cell that contains the document title, author, and any other options you need to specify. Note that you can switch the type of a cell to Raw using the notebook toolbar:

```{txt}
---
title: "Python for Data Science"
author: "Moinul Islam"
date: "4/30/2024"
format: 
  html:
    code-fold: FALSE
jupyter: python3
---
```

Note that weâ€™ve added the jupyter: python3 option to the `YAML` front matter to indicate which `Jupyter kernel` to render with. You would render this document with:

```{txt}
quarto render basics-jupyter.qmd
```

##### Converting Notebooks

You can convert between `.ipynb` and `.qmd` representations of a notebook using the quarto convert command. For example:

```{txt}
quarto convert basics-jupyter.ipynb # converts to .qmd
quarto convert basics-jupyter.qmd   # converts to .ipynb
```

##### Render without Preview

```{txt}
quarto render notebook.ipynb
quarto render notebook.ipynb --to docx
quarto render notebook.ipynb --to pdf
```

##### JupyterLab Extension

The Quarto `JuptyerLab` extension enables `JupyterLab` which use Quarto markdown to properly display the contents of the markdown cells. 

```{txt}
python3 -m pip install jupyterlab-quarto  # Mac
py -m pip install jupyterlab-quarto  # Windows
```

# Quarto for academic writing

- Making sub figures in quarto document

```{txt}
#| label: fig-1
#| fig-cap: "Inclusive wealth of India from 1990 to 2018"
#| out.width: "50%"
#| echo: false
#| fig-subcap: 
#|   - "1990"
#|   - "2000"
#|   - "2010"
#|   - "2018"
#| layout-ncol: 2

knitr::include_graphics('figures/iw_1990.jpg')
knitr::include_graphics('figures/iw_2000.jpg')
knitr::include_graphics('figures/iw_2010.jpg')
knitr::include_graphics('figures/iw_2018.jpg')
```

- For loading a figure with customizing options, we can use following codes

```{txt}
{r, echo=FALSE, out.height="60%", out.width="60%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap="Discipline"}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/discipline.jpg")
```

Here, we can adjust the height, width, alignment and caption of the figure.
