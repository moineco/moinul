The use of social and field experiments to test economic policies has accelerated in recent years. To bridge the gap between a theory and an actual economic policies that solves fundamental social problems, it is important to observe and evaluate the performance of a **mechanism** in the context of actual decisions faced by real people.

# Geoinformatics mechanism

I establish **geoinformatics mechanism** through which I aim to suggest improvements in climate change adaptation and natural disasters mitigation. In this mechanism, I will incorporate geoinformatics to enhance existing climate change and natural disasters adaptation strategies by leveraging advancements in information and communication technology. Through this **geoinformatics mechanism**, I aim to reduce vulnerability and the costs associated with climate change and natural disasters. I am now developing an experimental design to implement **geoinformatics mechanism** in experimental economics and environmental economics.
