# Geoinformatics mechanism

I establish **geoinformatics mechanism** through which I aim to suggest improvements in climate change adaptation and natural disasters mitigation. In this mechanism, I will incorporate geoinformatics to enhance existing climate change and natural disasters adaptation strategies by leveraging advancements in information and communication technology. Through this **geoinformatics mechanism**, I aim to reduce vulnerability and the costs associated with climate change and natural disasters. I am now developing an experimental design to implement **geoinformatics mechanism** in experimental economics and environmental economics.
