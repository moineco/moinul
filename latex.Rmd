\subcaptionbox{\label{1b}1985} {\rotatebox{0}{\scalebox{.4}{\includegraphics{o131b}}}}

#### `ulem`
The `ulem` package provides various types of underlining that can stretch between words and be broken across lines in LaTeX or plain TeX. Such underlining is given by the `\uline` command, leaving the original `\underline` command available for math mode.

For instance, `\url{http://www.overleaf.com}`, will show the url passed as parameter and make it into a link, useful if you will print the document.

```{txt}
\usepackage{url}
```

#### `xcolor`
The package starts from the basic facilities of the color package, and provides easy driver-independent access to several kinds of color tints, shades, tones, and mixes of arbitrary colors.
