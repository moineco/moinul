\usepackage{oldgerm}
```

#### **`pgfplots`**

The `pgfplots` package, which is based on `TikZ`, is a powerful visualization tool and ideal for creating scientific/technical graphics. The basic idea is that you provide the input data/formula and `pgfplots` does the rest.

```{txt}
\usepackage{pgfplots}
```

#### **`pythontex`**

PythonTeX executes code in LaTeX documents and allows the output to be included in the original document. It supports Python as well as Bash, JavaScript, Julia, Octave, Perl, R, Raku (Perl 6), Ruby, Rust, and SageMath. 

```{tex}
\usepackage{pythontex}
```

#### **`rotating`**

A package built on the standard LaTeX graphics package to perform all the different sorts of rotation one might like, including complete figures and tables with their captions. The package provides two new environments, `sidewaystable` and `sidewaysfigure`, each of which produces a single page-size float with contents rotated ±90 degrees.

```{txt}
\usepackage{rotating}
```

#### **`setspace`**

Provides support for setting the spacing between lines in a document. Package options include `singlespacing`, `onehalfspacing`, and `doublespacing`. Alternatively the spacing can be changed as required with the `\singlespacing`, `\onehalfspacing`, and `\doublespacing` commands. Other size `spacings` also available.

...
\end{spacing}
```


```{txt}
\usepackage{setspace}
```

#### **`siunitx`**
This is a comprehensive (SI) units package. Typesetting values with units requires care to ensure that the combined mathematical meaning of the value plus unit combination is clear. In particular, the SI units system lays down a consistent set of units with rules on how they are to be used

The package provides the user macros:

```{txt}
\ang[⟨options⟩]{⟨angle⟩}
\num[⟨options⟩]{⟨number⟩}
\unit[⟨options⟩]{⟨unit⟩}
\qty[⟨options⟩]{⟨number⟩}{⟨unit⟩}
\numlist[⟨options⟩]{⟨numbers⟩}
\numproduct[⟨options⟩]{⟨numbers⟩}
\numrange[⟨options⟩]{⟨numbers⟩}{⟨number2⟩}
\qtylist[⟨options⟩]{⟨numbers⟩}{⟨unit⟩}
\qtyproduct[⟨options⟩]{⟨numbers⟩}{⟨unit⟩}
\qtyrange[⟨options⟩]{⟨number1⟩}{⟨number2⟩}{⟨unit⟩}
\complexnum[⟨options⟩]{⟨number⟩}
\complexqty[⟨options⟩]{⟨number⟩}{⟨unit⟩}
\sisetup{⟨options⟩}
\tablenum[⟨options⟩]{⟨number⟩}
```

```{txt}
\usepackage{siunitx}
```

#### **`subcaption`** 

This package offers an user interface to typeset sub-captions.

```{txt}
\usepackage{subcaption}
```

```{txt}
\begin{figure} 
\begin{center} 
\begin{tabular}{cc} 
\subcaptionbox{\label{1a}1975} {\rotatebox{0}{\scalebox{.4}{\includegraphics{o131a}}}} & 
\subcaptionbox{\label{1b}1985} {\rotatebox{0}{\scalebox{.4}{\includegraphics{o131b}}}} 
\end{tabular} 
\caption{\label{fig1}Walmart store openings for every 10 years} 
\end{center} 
\end{figure}
```

#### **`tabularx`**

A new environment, `tabularx`, is defined, which takes the same arguments as tabular*, but modifies the widths of certain columns, rather than the inter column space, to set a table with the requested total width. The columns that may stretch are marked with the new token `X` in the preamble argument. This package requires the `array` package.

```{txt}
\usepackage{tabularx}
```

#### **`textcomp`**

The package supports the Text Companion fonts, which provide many text symbols (such as `baht`, `bullet`, `copyright`, `musicalnote`, `onequarter`, `section`, and `yen`).

```{txt}
\usepackage{textcomp}
```

#### **`threeparttable`**

This package facilitates tables with titles (captions) and notes.

```{txt}
\usepackage[para]{threeparttable}
```

- `para`: Notes come one-after-another without line breaks

```{txt}
\begin{table} 
\begin{center} 
\caption{\label{t1}The state of nature} 
\begin{threeparttable} 
\begin{tabular}{lc}
\toprule 1&2\\
\midrule 4&3\\
\bottomrule 
\end{tabular} 
\begin{tablenotes} 
\item ***, ** and * are significant at the \(\SI{1}{\%}\), \(\SI{5}{\%}\) and \(\SI{10}{\%}\) levels, respectively 
\end{tablenotes} 
\end{threeparttable} 
\end{center} 
\end{table}
```

#### **`times`**

The `times` package select Adobe Times Roman (or equivalent) as default font. The package is now obsolete, replaced by the mathptmx package, which supports Times Roman text and (mostly) matching mathematics. 

```{txt}
\usepackage{times}
```

#### **`ulem`**

The `ulem` package provides various types of underlining that can stretch between words and be broken across lines in LaTeX or plain TeX. Such underlining is given by the `\uline` command, leaving the original `\underline` command available for math mode. 

```{txt}
\usepackage[normalem]{ulem}
```

#### **`url`**
The command `\url` is a form of verbatim command that allows linebreaks at certain characters or combinations of characters, accepts reconfiguration, and can usually be used in the argument to another command. The command is intended for email addresses, hypertext links, directories/paths, etc., which normally have no spaces, so by default the package ignores spaces in its argument. 

For instance, `\url{http://www.overleaf.com}`, will show the url passed as parameter and make it into a link, useful if you will print the document.

```{txt}
\usepackage{url}
```

#### **`xcolor`**
The package starts from the basic facilities of the color package, and provides easy driver-independent access to several kinds of color tints, shades, tones, and mixes of arbitrary colors.

```{txt}
\usepackage{xcolor}
```
