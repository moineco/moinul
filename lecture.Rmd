# E. Data Science with R and Python

In this course, I will introduce you to two of the most widely-used programming languages for data science: R and Python. You will gain experience working with real-world data, and leave the course with skills you can apply in other courses.

#### Course Objectives 
By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Use GitHub, R, and Python for basic data analysis and version control.
- Perform exploratory data analysis in R.
- Use strings and lists in python.
- Test statistical hypotheses using R functions.
- Create readable functions for efficient task management.
- Manipulate real-world data to enable further analysis.
- Choose and implement efficient methods for analyzing data sets.
- Gather real-world data that can be analyzed to address a modeling question.
- Synthesize analysis of gathered data for stakeholders.
